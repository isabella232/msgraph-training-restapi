## IMPORTANT

**This project is being archived. As part of the archival process, we're closing all open issues and pull requests.**

**You can continue to use this sample "as-is", but it won't be maintained moving forward. We apologize for any inconvenience.**

This module will introduce you to working with the Microsoft Graph REST API to access data in Office 365.

## Lab - Build apps with the Microsoft Graph REST API

In this lab you will leverage the Microsoft Graph REST API to create an ASP.NET MVC application using the Azure AD v2 authentication endpoint and the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) to access data in Office 365. You will also learn how to perform manual authentication with Azure AD and call the Microsoft Graph REST API endpoint using raw HTTP calls.
